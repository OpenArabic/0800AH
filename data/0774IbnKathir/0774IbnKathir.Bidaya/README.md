Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose one of the Shamela version - it was the longest with 20 volumes and there is a matiching PDF available. Still I was a bit confused as the texts in the folder seem to have differing contents, which made it hard to chose which is the "right" text.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text
