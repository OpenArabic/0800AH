If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose the JK version. There didn't seemed to be hugh differences in the quality of the three version. The shia and shamela version comprise 4 volumes - the JK version 8 volumes. Still the number of bibliographical entries is the same in the three version. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

pdf in urls (last one)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)
