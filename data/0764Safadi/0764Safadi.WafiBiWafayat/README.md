# Please, answer the following questions about the text that you work on

[[Last update: August 15, 2016]]

Copy-paste these questions into the README.md file and answer them.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

MGR: chose JK version; they are all identical; based on the same edition; formatted in the same manner, but JK has more tags already in place; I am under impression that Shamela and Shia versions are based on JK

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Ahmad Arnaut / Turki Mustafa (metadata in each text file); texts is an exact reproduction of the edition, although structural elements are not always formatted; pagination is the same.

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Reproduction is very clean; I have not run into any typos, although there must be --- the book is almost 30 volumes.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

The formatting is quite messy; it will take a while to mARkdown this book ...
