Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Only Shamela version available. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

See urls. Text is close to the edition. Pagination is the same - there are sometimes smaler differences (short parts missing, numbering of names is not existant in the text...)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Started working on the text accidentialy (it's not listed in the priority list). 
-> I stopped working on it when I found out about it (~20 % done).
The tagging is quite time consuming, because many proper names are not marked.
If this text is needed I can go on working on it.
