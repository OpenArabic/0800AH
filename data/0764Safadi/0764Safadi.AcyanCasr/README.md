Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Only Shamela version available. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

See urls. Text is close to the edition. Pagination is the same - there are sometimes smaler differences (short parts missing, numbering of names is not existant in the text...)

## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Type your response here.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Started working on the text accidentialy (it's not listed in the priority list). 
-> I stopped working on it when I found out about it (~20 % done).
The tagging is quite time consuming, because many proper names are not marked.

Until the bibliographilcal entry 337 only 331 are tagged (6 are missing)

Restarted tagging again on the 03.10.2017
