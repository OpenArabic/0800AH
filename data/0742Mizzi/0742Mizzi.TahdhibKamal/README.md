If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Shamela was chosen, which seems to be as good as JK, concerning the number of marked entries. Schia has poor quality. PDF is close to all of them.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Link for PDF is in url-document.
Pagination is the same.


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

four typos found - all concerning numbering

## 4. Add any comments on the text

very time consuming, because there were 35 volumes and some entries couldn't be marked by regex very well. The quality of the tagging is good I would suppose, sometimes still I didn't checked with the PDF to save time. 
In the last volume there is a section with womens biographies.
- first 250 pages are not properly marked yet
- some of the cross references are still marked with $ instead of $$. They are the ones without numbers so it should be easy to find them.
